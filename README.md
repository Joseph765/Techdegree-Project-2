My goal for this project is to take a long list of students and divide them up into different pages that make it easier for the user 
to se the full list of students. The goal is to only use javascript to create each element that will be created for this project. 

The first task to complete is to some outer scope variables, namely a variable that store the number of students that I assign to each
page and a variable that targets all of the list items on the page. The first function I will create will accept 2 parameters, 
one being the list thatthe program will divide up and the page number that the program needs to display. 
The second function is going to call the first function later on.
The roll of the second function is to create and append links to the bottom of the page that the user can click to navigate to 
the different pages, and once clicked will call the first function. I will also implement a search feature for easy navigation, 
and a message that will print 'No results found', when there are no results found.

In order to complete this project I will need to have a solid grasp on loops an arrays, to loops through each list item in an array
to display on each selected page. This project requires knowledge pertaining to DOM manipulation to append varius nodes to the page 
using JavaScript. I will need to know how to write event listeners to respond to user interactions with the buttons I will be appending.
